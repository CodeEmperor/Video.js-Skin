## How to use it
You can find example implementation in the **index.html** file.
To use it, you need to attach **videojs-skin.css** and **videojs-skin.js** files to your site.

## Differences in comparison to original Video.js player skin:
1. Moved fullscreen button to right corner of video, and slightly changed its look.
2. Changes in design and position of big play button
3. Control bar - set new background and opacity to buttons in control bar, changed sizes etc.
4. Completly changed chapter buttons - move it outside the control bar, set all chapters in row, every chapter showed as half opacity bar.
